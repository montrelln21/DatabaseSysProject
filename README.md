5.  List all of the students in a given course;
6.  List all of the students in a course and all of their scores on every assignment;
7.  Add an assignment to a course;
8.  Change the percentages of the categories for a course;
9.  Add 2 points to the score of each student on an assignment;
10. Add 2 points just to those students whose last name contains a '0'
11. Compute the grade for a student;
12. Compute the grade for a student, where the lowest score for a given category is dropped.

1. Executing/Run the "TABLES" portion of the code that will create the tables needed to proceed.
2. Executing/Run the "VALUES" portion of the code that will insert the values needed to proceed.
